"""Outlook desktop integration through COM (pywin32).

Deployment constraints worth knowing before touching this file:

* Only *classic* Outlook for Windows exposes a COM automation surface. The new
  Outlook client does not, and no amount of patching here will change that.
* COM requires an interactive desktop session. A Scheduled Task configured with
  "Run whether user is logged on or not" fails under session 0 isolation. Use an
  "on logon" trigger with repetition instead, on a machine that stays signed in.
